## Problem Statement
Survivors fleeing domestic violence do not have immediate access to housing, trapping them between homelessness and returning to abuse. 
Emergency shelter and transitional housing continue to be the most urgent unmet needs for domestic violence survivors.

### What’s it like?
- 77 different screening criterias (King County)
- Five rounds of screening
- In person requirements, multiple phone calls
- Average one year wait from initial hotline inquiry
- 300 families had been on the waitlist for more than 18 months

### What's it cause?
- Desperate financial decisions → long term debt 
- Homelessness
- Destroys dignity in the process
